# Taskmaster - Weekend 3 Challenge
## What it does
- This app takes in your name and a task and on the click of the submit button it adds them to a database named `tasks`.
- I have a SQL file you can use attatched in the repo, feel free to add more data as needed.
- There is a delete button on each task, on click it deletes the entry from the database.
- There is also a submit completion button which changes your completion status from Yes to No according to the dropdown.
